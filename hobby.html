    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> One of my hobbies is playing video games competitively.</p>
    <p> I enjoy play FPS games like Valorant, Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, and League Of Legends</p>

    <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
    <p>I first got into competitive gaming when I was 7 years old. </p>
    <p>I would play video games with ym big brother and when I was 7 I first started playing Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3</p>
    <p>I play BO3 for a long time and got some of the hardest things to get like Dark Matter and Mater Prestige Level 1000</p>
    <p>After BO3 got old I played Fortnite and even got some earngins playing the game</p>
    <p> Now, I play hero shooters and FPS like Val, OW2, MR, and LOL</p>
    <p> I am even on the team for MR and Val at my school, IIT</p>

    <h2>What I Enjoy Most</h2>
    <p>Playing video games makes me happy because I have a very competitive spirit and through video games I can use it.</p>
    <p> Overall I also think that playing games are a lot of fun and not just competitive. I meet lots of new people and even some of my best friend now have come from online games</p>

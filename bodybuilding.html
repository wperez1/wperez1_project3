    <h2>Why I love body building</h2>
    <p>Body building is really important to me because it serves as a way to vent out problems while spending time with my dad and building a better physique. </p>
    <p>I work out with my dad and I use bodybuilding as a way to spend time with him and also make us more fit and strong</p>
    <p> Body building for me serves as a way to relieve stress by exerting force lifting heavy weights</p>

    <h2>My Training Routine</h2>
    <p>The split that I follow right now is a upper lower rest split. This means that I work upp body, then lower, body and then rest. This makes it so in a week I train each muscle group at least twice</p>
    <p>When I do upper body I start off with chest. I Like to do at least 2 different excercises per muscle group. So for chest I do a heavy pressing movement like incline bench then a squeezing movement like chest flys.</p>

    <p> Following that I work back. I do a row and a pulldown for lats and mid/upper back</p>
    <p> Afterwards I do my triceps and biceps. For triceps I do pushdowns or skullcrushers and for biceps I do incline curls and hammer curls.</p>
    <p> Lastly for upper body is your shoulders. For this do lateral raises and rear delt flys focusing on the stretch position</p>
    <p> Going on is legs. First is barbell squat. I like to go heavy so I train for strength and go for 6-8 reps. On heavier sets I only do 3.</p>

    <p> For the other side of legs I like to go heavy on deadlifts or rdls.</p>

    <p> On rest days you can do abs and before you start your bodybuilding exercises you should do some cardio.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition and Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>For my diet I like to use a macro tracker and follow the calorie deficit and protein goals it sets for me. This way its easy for me to follow my diet.</p>
